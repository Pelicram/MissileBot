| <ul><li>won but demote</li><li>wbd</li></ul> | Did you win and demote?<br>This happens when your client is out of sync with the server. Typically, a desync happens when you leave a game before the post-game scoreboard. Everything is correct on the server side. Your game client will not update the amount of points you lost [or won] until you restart the game or complete another game in the same playlist and stay until the post-game menu.<br>If you lost your previous game(s), the demotion will show the next time you reach the post-game scoreboard. |

| <ul><li>hour</li><li>skill</li></ul> | The number of hours played to reach a rank shouldn't be used as measure of skill. Everyone learns at their own rate. Please watch this explanation by Pro player CJCJ: https://clips.twitch.tv/WonderfulBillowingTomatoBrokeBack |

| <ul><li>season reward win</li><li>swr</li></ul> | [Image: Season Reward Level Bar](https://rocketleague.media.zestyio.com/Season-Reward-Level-Bar-2.jpg)<br>In the image above, the \"Unranked Season Reward Level\" on the left indicates your current reward level. For instance, if it is on the Gold Season Reward Level, you have unlocked the Bronze, Silver, and Gold rewards for this season.<br>The right side indicates the rank you require to progress to the next tier's reward. Wins only count towards your Season Reward by playing at Bronze tier or higher. But a Gold player who has unlocked Gold Season Rewards cannot yet unlock Platinum Season Rewards.<br>Your Reward Level starts at Unranked, and each win earns you progress towards the next level. Each Reward Level requires 10 wins to unlock, and they are sequential - you unlock Silver rewards after Bronze, Gold after Silver, and so on.<br>&nbsp;<br><sup>**Can I lose Season Reward Levels if I lose matches or drop a skill tier?**</sup><br><sup>You will not lose progress towards your season rewards. Losses do not subtract from your win total, and your progress will be stored even if you get demoted.</sup><br><sup>**How do different playlists interact with the Season Reward Level?**</sup><br><sup>You can earn wins towards leveling up from any Competitive Playlist. However, you still only earn wins for matches of sufficient rank. If you 2v2 rank is Platinum and your 3v3 rank is Silver, 3v3 wins will only count towards Silver Reward Level and below.</sup><br>Source: [Blog](https://www.rocketleague.com/news/changes-competitive-season-5) |
| <ul><li>team</li></ul> | There is no special pool of bad players for you. Teams are assigned randomly that balance out. Your 'awful teammates' are your 'awful opponents' in your next game. The ONLY constant in all of your games is you.<br>If you were better than the average player at your rank, you would have ranked up. Since you don't rank up, you're probably right where you belong.<br>I know it's a hard pill to swallow but you're literally wasting your energy complaining about random players you will never meet again. You can't improve the skills of other players. You can only improve your own.<br>Until you're ready to look at the one thing you CAN affect, your own performance, I'm afraid you're gonna stay where you are. |
| <ul><li>demo</li></ul> | Demolitions are a valid strategy.<br>1. Demos were deliberately programmed into the game by the developers. If they didn't want there to be demos in 1v1 or any gamemode. They would make non-contact rules and phase cars through each other (they can do that, they have experience in another game they developed "Nosgoth" which has that.<br>2. Demos are completely avoidable. It's not like it's a broken mechanic with no disadvantages. You can see a player coming at you, and evade him. Either by jumping, double jumping, dodging left/right, turning, braking, doing nothing (faking), etc.<br>3. Demos have their own disadvantages. It takes boost to get to high speed in a short amount of time. It can put you severely out of position, especially if you miss. And finally, demos are something you go out of the way for and take extra time when there are usually better options to do things.<br>4. It's a tool. Tools are not disrespectful. Some players are more demo-heavy, others are not. Acting like it's disrespectful is trying to apply your own weird ethics onto someone else. If there is an opportunity to score and it involves a demo, of course they can take it. The game's about winning with the tools available, not about who can win with the most mechanical skill. Mechanical skill is only a fraction of the skill in this game. Demos are their own skill too. |
| <ul><li>lag</li></ul> | **If you experience server issues:**<br>When you talk about servers, remember to mention which Region you're playing. For instance it's possible that US-West is down, while everything else works fine.<br>**Rocket League connection requirements:**<br>Rocket League requires precise and consistent information because of fast inter-acting physics. There is nowhere for a bad connection to hide. You need a quality connection without [packetloss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_loss) or [jitter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jitter#Packet_jitter_in_computer_networks). WiFi is the most common reason for bad connections.<br>[WiFi is bad for gaming](https://www.pcgamer.com/heres-how-playing-on-wi-fi-hurts-your-game/). For all games. Some games types can reduce the effects of a bad connection. But make no mistake, your WiFi is a handicap in those games as well.<br>Use a [ ethernet cable](https://www.google.com/search?q=ethernet+cable+amazon) and you have perfected your home network. For all games.<br>On rare occasions it is not possible to get a [cable](https://www.google.com/search?q=ethernet+cable+amazon) from the router to the console/pc. Then [power line adapters](https://www.google.com/search?q=powerline+adapter) are a reasonable alternative. They are much more expensive than a 5$ cable, and perform worse. But still much better than WiFi.<br>**How to test your connection:**<br>- First you need to find a Rocket League server IPs to test. [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/download.html) can do that. Have it running while you play a Casual match to find the server IP.<br>- If you don't want to install Wireshark, you can open Launch.log located in \Documents\My Games\Rocket League\TAGame\Logs and search for StartJoin and copy the IP that looks something like 212.142.22.23.<br>- Then you test your connection for that Rocket League server IP using a program like [winmtr](https://sourceforge.net/projects/winmtr). Leave it running for some time and paste the results.<br>- Rocket League requires less than 1mbit bandwidth. It doesn't matter whether you have 10mbit or 1000mbit. This means bandwidth tests like speedtest.net are near irrelevant when testing a connection quality for gaming. You are also not testing your connection towards a Rocket League server. |
